# cordova-plugin-volume-buttons

**Detect volume button presses (up/down) on iOS â€“ even when the phone is locked.**  
Perfect for remote-controlling Cordova-based magic apps (or other stealth interactions).

âœ¨ Built by @ragcsalo (Benke Smith) to help magicians perform real magic with invisible input.

## âœ… Features

- Detect **Volume Up / Down** button presses
- Works even when:
  - App is **in the background**
  - Phone is **locked**
- Three modes:
  - `aggressive`: blocks the system volume bar and resets volume after each press
  - `silent`: shows the system volume UI, lets volume change, still detects presses
  - `none`: disables all volume detection
